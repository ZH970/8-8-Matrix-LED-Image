* ***Devel:***

This devel part is aim to helping those machine that don't have lights on the 74HC595, which to show the binary data.

Therefore, I redirect the LED module of the single-chip microcomputer to be 74HC595 dev-tool.

Also, you can improve it to meet your needs.

Tip:

**This LED only play its role well when you show just one dot on the Matrix_Led.**
